# About Plugin Configuration Files

All plugin configuration files are `.yml` files that need to be made manually.
They need to be made in the `config/plugins/` folder.
Plugin configuration files need to be named after the main command name of
their respective commands.
For example, if you are making a configuration file for the `>>slots` command,
the configuration file needs to be named `slots.yml`. They can not use command
alternate names/aliases.

# Reaction Addition Logging

The configuration file of the `>>addreact` command is used to specify the logging channel for the command.
Whenever a new reaction is added, information about it is sent to that channel.
